# Do Me a Favor


### Intro
DoMeAFavor is an online platform that serves both nonprofit organization and its volunteers and makes their connction more tight and offers them convenience in exchanging their work status and feedback. This idea is derived from my real 8-month volunteer work with a local nonprofit organization-[FriendshipWorks](http://www.fw4elders.org), which helps the elderly in Boston area to reduce their isolation. During the time I was doing this volunteer work, I found that the organization coordinators should email all the volunteers everytime they have events to do and besides, the volunteers rarely have opportunity to know each other because there is no media and only one group meeting held every year.

So I am thinking to build a platform to help the volunteer organization post their needs and receive the feedback from their volunteers conveniently, and the volunteers could also make friends on this platform. This project could drastically reduce the organization's work to contact volunteers and monitor their work. Volunteers could also get benefit from it and know more new friends.
